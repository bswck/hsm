# hsm – High School Math
An amateur library project devoted to mathematics for the need to better understand it and explore 
computer techniques for manipulating mathematical objects. I'm doing it to prepare for maths 
and computer science matura exams in one fell swoop.

### Primary goals for the library
1. Mathematical knowledge graph for breaking down math problems (high school level of difficulty!) 
into coherent parts through theorems and computations. The graph is planned to be a 
representation of mathematical knowledge as faithful, as possible.
2. Digital storage of mathematical expressions with an easy-to-use API.
3. The ability to modify elementary mathematical operations and add new ones, for fun, experiments 
or to discover something which must have been discovered a long time ago by some Greek or Arab 
anyway.
4. Resource of basic algorithms needed to know for the CS matura exam 
(e.g. Horner's method used for computing values of polynomials).
